## getting and cleaning data

Created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5 Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

ouputs are labeled tidydata.csv for the large 10299 row output
and tidydata2.csv for the smaller output that averages each variable for each activity and each subject
